Hi! Welcome to my website. 

I recently completed my Ph.D. from the [Department of Physics and Astronomy](https://physics.wvu.edu/) at [West Virginia University](https://www.wvu.edu/). I developed algorithms to automatically find and study rare astrophysical events (called Fast Radio Bursts). 
You can find some of my past research projects [here](/research/). I now want to solve real-world problems using the data analysis and machine learning skills I learned in my undergraduate and graduate studies.
