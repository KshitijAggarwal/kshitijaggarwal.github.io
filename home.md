Hi! Welcome to my personal website. 

I am a PhD student at the Department of Physics and Astronomy at West Virginia University. I write [code](https://github.com/KshitijAggarwal) to find Fast Radio Bursts, and delegate some of my tasks to Machine Learning. You can find the details of my ongoing projects [here](/research/). I love to read, used to write blogs and have dabbled with poetry as well. Feel free to look around using the tabs on the top.   

You can find my cv ([here](/docs/kshitij_cv.pdf)) and a list of my publications ([here](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/public-libraries/yUUKwaFhRVu2DCvZ4A3HXg)).
