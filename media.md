### Teaching 
I co-led bi-weekly sessions of chapters from the book [Dive into Deep Learning](https://d2l.ai/) for [Machine Learning Tokyo](https://machinelearningtokyo.com/). We discussed the basic concepts and reimplemented selected models from scratch in PyTorch. All the slides, notebooks and videos of the sessions are available [here](https://github.com/Machine-Learning-Tokyo/d2l.ai).
