During the day, I work as a Data Scientist trying to develop ways to provide cancer patients with the right therapy using Machine Learning and Statistics. After this, I spend my time reading, thinking, running, cooking and just gathering experiences. 

I love to solve problems, and have acquired lots of skills in solving problems during my undergrad and [grad school](/gradschool).
