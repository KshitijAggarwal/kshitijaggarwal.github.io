Originally from Roorkee, a small town in Uttarakhand, India, I went to [IIT Ropar](http://www.iitrpr.ac.in/) for my undergrad in Electrical Engineering. After a summer internship at [DISTORTION](http://www.rri.res.in/DISTORTION/) group at the [Raman Research Institute](http://www.rri.res.in/) and a couple of projects at [National Centre for Radio Astronomy](http://www.ncra.tifr.res.in/ncra/main), I decided to pursue a PhD in radio astronomy. The transition from Electrical Engineering to an astronomy PhD was pretty interesting, and I plan to write about it in a blog someday. 

Currently, I am a final year PhD student in the [Department of Physics and Astronomy](https://physics.wvu.edu/) at West Virginia University. I primarily work on search and analysis of FRBs using various algorithms and machine learning techniques. 

When not thinking about FRBs, I spend my time [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27276657-kshitij-aggarwal). I used to read fiction and philosophy but nowadays I am mostly into non-fiction like world history and biographies. I also like to write, and used to write blogs on the following platforms: [Quora](https://qr.ae/TVcWH2) and [Medium](https://medium.com/@kshitijaggarwal_13609). I am a fan of thought provoking movies, and have seen almost all the good ones (feel free to suggest any underrated ones).
