I did a Ph.D. from the [Department of Physics and Astronomy](https://physics.wvu.edu/) at [West Virginia University](https://www.wvu.edu/). I developed algorithms to automatically find and study rare astrophysical events (called Fast Radio Bursts).

_Image Sources: [Lorimer Burst](http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/F/Fast+Radio+Bursts), [GBT](https://public.nrao.edu/telescopes/gbt/), [VLA](https://public.nrao.edu/telescopes/vla/), [Arecibo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arecibo_Observatory)_

My research focused on detection and study of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs). Discovered by [Duncan Lorimer](https://physics.wvu.edu/faculty-and-staff/faculty/duncan-lorimer) in 2007, these bursts are very bright flashes in the sky, originating in the galaxies far far away. As the name suggests, FRBs have been seen only at radio frequencies (400MHz-8GHz). Therefore, I used the amazing radio telescopes in US ([VLA](http://www.vla.nrao.edu/), [GBT](https://greenbankobservatory.org/science/telescopes/gbt/), [Arecibo](https://www.naic.edu/ao/new-landing)) to search for these enigmatic phenomenon. [Sarah Burke-Spolaor](https://sarahspolaor.faculty.wvu.edu/) was my amazing supervisor. My thesis is available here: [Searching Harder, Localizing Better, Classifying Faster: Optimizing Fast Radio Burst Detection And Analysis](https://researchrepository.wvu.edu/etd/10249/).

I was also a part of the [*`Realfast`*](http://realfast.io/) collaboration, which performs real-time fast transients searches using VLA. Taking advantage of the large baselines of VLA antennas (and the fact that it is an interferometer), the *`Realfast`* system can localize FRBs to a very small region in sky (~sub-arcseconds). This is useful as localization is necessary to pin-point FRBs to individual galaxies, which is essential to identify their progenitors. 

I also thought a lot about efficient search and classification algorithms for FRBs. I (along with [Devansh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/devanshkv)) developed a Deep Learning based classifier called [`Fetch`](https://github.com/devanshkv/fetch) for classification of FRB candidates from noise (RFI) candidates. `Fetch` is currently being used at more than half a dozen radio telescopes all around the world, and has detected hundreds of bursts!

I led a project called [TPP](https://github.com/thepetabyteproject) (The Petabyte Project) to perform a uniform sensitivity automated search for FRBs on more than a petabyte of archival data.

I also developed many software packages for FRB analysis: classification, period search, data processing, etc. Take a look at my [Github](https://github.com/KshitijAggarwal) for more information.
