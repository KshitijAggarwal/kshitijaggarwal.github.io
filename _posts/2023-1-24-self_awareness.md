Self awareness is about understanding ourselves. 
About our attachment style. 
About our trauma. <!--more-->
About our childhood and how it changed us. 
About why we like this, that, etc. 
only then can you be in a secure attachment, at that right balance of give and take. And still be open to criticism, be okay to be wrong. Be okay to fail.

Self awareness is what we owe our potential partner, because we first have to become the person that ideal partner deserves.
