When you loose someone, you go through three steps: 
Habit, memories and loneliness. <!--more-->

Initially it’s the breaking of that habit that hurts. You can’t see them, talk to them, be with them, like you used to. 

Then comes the memories. Of all the time (good and bad) spent together. 

Then finally loneliness; reminding you how utterly lonely you actually are on this planet.
