# Graduate Experience

I did a Ph.D. from the [Department of Physics and Astronomy](https://physics.wvu.edu/) at [West Virginia University](https://www.wvu.edu/). 
I developed algorithms to automatically find and study rare astrophysical events (called Fast Radio Bursts). 

## Research

My research focused on detection and study of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs). Discovered in 2007, these bursts are very bright flashes in the sky, originating in the galaxies far far away. As the name suggests, FRBs have been seen only at radio frequencies (400MHz-8GHz). Therefore, I used the amazing radio telescopes in US ([VLA](http://www.vla.nrao.edu/), [GBT](https://greenbankobservatory.org/science/telescopes/gbt/), [Arecibo](https://www.naic.edu/ao/new-landing)) to search for these. If you are bold and curious enough to read, my thesis is available here: [Searching Harder, Localizing Better, Classifying Faster: Optimizing Fast Radio Burst Detection And Analysis](https://researchrepository.wvu.edu/etd/10249/).

I was also a part of the [Realfast](http://realfast.io/) collaboration, which performs real-time fast transients searches using VLA. This system can localize FRBs to a very small region in sky (~sub-arcseconds). This is useful as localization is necessary to pin-point FRBs to individual galaxies, which is essential to identify their sources. 

I also developed many software packages for FRB analysis: classification, period search, data processing, etc. Take a look at my [Github](https://github.com/KshitijAggarwal) for more information.
